# What I’ll analyze next (once you fix the above)

After the cleanup I will dig into:

🧠 Architecture — folder structure, code organization  
⚠️ Bugs & anti‑patterns — what will break in real use  
💡 Efficiency — lazy loading, component structure, state management  
📌 Missing practices — tests, env strategy, deployment config

But right now, the **most critical flaw** is the `.env` exposure and README.

Fix those, then we go into code quality.

## Brutal truth

Your project is *not bad* as a basic frontend skeleton. But it currently looks like a **template drop** — not a thoughtfully built app.

Real projects have:
- Clean documentation
- No secrets in source control
- Clear folder separation (components, pages, services)
- Proper config management

Right now, this is halfway there, but sloppy. Clean it up and then we’ll grind into the code itself.

Reply with **done** after you fix `.env` and update README, and I’ll proceed to actual code review.
